The PostgreSQL version 15 is obsolete, but the server or client           
 │ packages are still installed. Please install the latest packages          
 │ (postgresql-16 and postgresql-client-16) and upgrade the existing         
 │ clusters with pg_upgradecluster (see manpage).                            
 │                                                                           
 │ Please be aware that the installation of postgresql-16 will               
 │ automatically create a default cluster 16/main. If you want to            
 │ upgrade the 15/main cluster, you need to remove the already existing      
 │ 16 cluster (pg_dropcluster --stop 16 main, see manpage for details).      
 │                                                                           
 │ The old server and client packages are no longer supported. After the     
 │ existing clusters are upgraded, the postgresql-15 and                     
 │ postgresql-client-15 packages should be removed.                          
 │                                                                           
 │ Please see /usr/share/doc/postgresql-common/README.Debian.gz for          
 │ details.
